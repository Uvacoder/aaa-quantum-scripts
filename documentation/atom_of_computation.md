## splitting information into bits

the first ting we need to know about is the idea of bits. these are designed to be the world's simplest alphabet. with only two char, 0 and 1. we can represent any piece information.

one example is number. you are probably used to representing a number through a string of the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. in this string of digits, each digit representhow many times the number contains a certain power of ten for example when write 9213, we mean

9000 + 200 + 10 + 3

or, expresed in a way that emphasizes the power of ten

(9x10)^3 + (2x10^2) + (10x10^1) + (3x10^0)

though we usually use this system base on the number 19, we can just as easily use one based on any other number. the binary number system, for example, is based on number two, this means using the two caracters 0 and 1 to express number as multiples of powers of two, for example 9213 become ``10001111111101``
