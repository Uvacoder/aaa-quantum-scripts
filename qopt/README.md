quantum inspired evolutionary algorithms for optimization problems

this folder contain some unpublished before source codes develope by arfy slwy in the 2021-2022. they were used for research on advanced randomised search algorithm (mainly quantum inspired evolutionary and genetic algorithm and other population method) for numerical and combinatinal optimization.

this program and algorithm were developed in different languages, c, C++, python and Cpython interfaces, Cuda C kernel, helper bash shell script and some algorithm even matlab

- **cuda**
  cuda c computational kernels implementing a few algorithm in GPGPus (superb fast up to several hundred speedup in multi gpu environment)
